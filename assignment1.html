        <h2>Premise</h2>
        <p>In the year 2033, a crew of six astronauts launch from Florida
            on a journey to be the first people to set foot on Mars. During
            the descent into the Martian atmosphere, there is a malfunction
            with their spacecraft, the Daedalus. They land 75.3 kilometres
            away from their planned habitat. On Earth their progress is being
            monitored. In the second season, the story jumps ahead several
            years into the future after the Daedalus astronauts have built
            a full-fledged colony called Olympus Town. Having established
            mankind as an interplanetary species, Season 2 examines the
            impact that humans have on the Red Planet and the consequences
            the planet has on us.

        <h2>But... What the Hell &#x1f914;</h2>
        <p>The crew looks encumbered as though by Mars' gravity.
            Since Mars' gravity is 15% of Earth's, shouldn't they rather be
            flying and having fun? Perhaps the spacesuits are too heavy or
            the journey (plus unfortunate landing) exhausted them.
